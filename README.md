# IDS
Intrusion detection system is a software that monitors networks and gives us details of incoming data packets over a network that either that data packet is an intrusion or normal data packet.
Here we used Machine Learning Algorithms To develop such model

ML ALGORITHMS WE USED 

LOGISTIC REGRESSION,

SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM),

NEURAL NETWORKS (DEEP LEARNING)

ACCURACY WAS UPTO 95%.
