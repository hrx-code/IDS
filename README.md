# IDS
Intrusion detection system is a software that monitors networks and gives us detail of incoming data packets that either that data packet is an intrusion or normal data packet.
here we used Machine Learning Algorithms To develop such model
ML ALGORITHMS WE USED 
LOGISTIC REGRESSION
SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM)
NEURAL NETWORKS (DEEP LEARNING)

ACCURACY WAS UPTO 95%.
